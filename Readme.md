# Generative Adversarial Networks

###### tags: `GANs`

**Generative modeling** is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset.

GANs are an exciting and rapidly changing field, delivering on the promise of generative models in their ability to generate realistic examples across a range of problem domains, most notably in image-to-image translation tasks such as translating photos of summer to winter or day to night, and in generating photorealistic photos of objects, scenes, and people that even humans cannot tell are fake.

Gans are improving and this is a flourishing field. So I decided to make this repository where I will push the notes and Implementations of some of the early and basic GAN architectures.

The following GANs will be implemented

- [x] Vannila Gans
- [x] DCGans
- [ ] Conditional Gans
- [ ] Cycle Gans

After these GANs are implemented I am looking forward to implementing some of the advanced and recent architectures.

Each implementation is in a saperate folder and each folder has their own readme file.
